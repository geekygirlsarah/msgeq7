# MSGEQ7 Sample

This is some code I used to test a couple of different methods of using the chip. One mode is 7 LEDs that vary in brightness to different frequencies. The other is lighting more or less LEDs depending on the amount of bass it's getting. (So basically like a beat detector, though less fancy.)

## Code
I've started using PlatformIO with Atom to upload my code. So the .cpp file is basically equivalent to an Arduino's .pde or .ino only with the extra `#include <Arduino.h>` at the top.

You should be able to get this project, open it up in Atom, then go to PlatformIO > Build, then PlatformIO > Upload.

It's written for the Mega2560, but can be modified for others.
